    "S.ingle Responsibility Principle: each piece of functionality here has one and \n",
    "only one purpose. In order to add or remove functionality related to a method\n",
    "that already exists, the maintainer would simply need to modify the corresponding\n",
    "class or method/function, OR add a new class/function to handle said functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "O.pen-closed Principle: \"Opened for extension, close for modification\" each class is \n",
    "easily extendable by adding a method, which does not require modification of the class \n",
    "itself. Notice how the shape_areas_sum() function does not include any logic to calculate \n",
    "area for any shapes, it simply calls the shapes built-in area property to perform the \n",
    "calculations. Adding this functionality is thereby simpler and more readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "L.iskov-Substitution Principle: \"Each subclass should be able to substitute for its parent(s)\".\n",
    "(Note that python supports multiple-inheritance). Notice how Circle and Square\n",
    "are able to substitute for Shape in any reasonable use case. This will involve \n",
    "calling super(cls, method) within overridden methods (if there was a prior \n",
    "implementation).\n",

    "I.nterface Segregation Principle: A client should never be forced to implement an\n",
    "interface that it does not use, not rely on methods that it does not use. Notice \n",
    "how Shape() does not implement volume() method, because 2-d shapes like squares \n",
